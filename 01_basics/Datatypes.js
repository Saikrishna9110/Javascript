let name="Saikrishna"
console.log(typeof name);  // gives string.

let x=45
console.log(typeof x); //gives number.

//we have many more datatypes

//number
//bigint
//string
//boolean
//null ==> standalone value
//undefined ==> variable id declared but not been assigned a value


//object


console.log(typeof null); //gives as object.

console.log(typeof undefined); // gives as undefined.

//remembering the types of null and undefined will be helpfull in the interviews.
